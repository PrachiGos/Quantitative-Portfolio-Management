# Quantitative-Portfolio-Management
This repository contains assignments and projects from my coursework in Quantitative Portfolio Management, implemented in MATLAB.

## ASSIGNMENT 1
This assignment covers fundamental operations in MATLAB related to matrix manipulation, portfolio return calculations, active portfolio performance evaluation, and regression analysis for asset pricing models.

Key tasks include:

1.  **Matrix Operations** – Creating and manipulating matrices, extracting submatrices, and formatting data into tables with row and column labels.
2.  **Portfolio Return Analysis** – Computing arithmetic and geometric mean returns for a given set of portfolio returns without using built-in functions.
3.  **Active Portfolio Performance** – Evaluating the geometric mean active return, tracking error, and information ratio to assess portfolio performance against a benchmark.
4.  **Regression Analysis for Asset Pricing** – Estimating Oracle’s alpha and beta using linear regression on excess returns, along with statistical significance testing.
